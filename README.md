### Hi there 👋

I am medical doctor and data analyst. I have a mission to make an impact in the disease prevention. I found during my medical practice that the majority of diseases can be avoided. I believe that the Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big Data can help us moving towards this goal. Working on large datasets with multiple features, testing hypothesis, creating a model represent a challenge for me.

Soft skills : Open to new ideas, listener, pragmatic, empathetic, federator, challenge taker, inclusive

You can find here some of my previous projects during my training in Ironhack Paris.
